<p>About the computer</p>
 <p>The first computers were used primarily for numerical calculations. However, as any information can be numerically encoded, people soon realized that computers are capable of 
<b>general-purpose information processing.</b> Their capacity to handle large amounts of data has extended the range and accuracy of weather forecasting. Their speed has allowed them to make decisions about routing telephone connections through a network and to control mechanical systems such as automobiles, nuclear reactors, and robotic surgical tools.
